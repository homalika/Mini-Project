            <h2>Home Remedies</h2>
            <p>Home remedies can help manage and reduce fever, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional if the fever is high, persistent, or accompanied by other severe symptoms.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of fluids like water, herbal teas, and clear broths to stay hydrated and help cool the body.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Rest:</strong> Ensure you get plenty of rest to help your body fight off the infection causing the fever.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Cool Compresses:</strong> Apply a cool, damp washcloth to your forehead, neck, or wrists to help reduce body temperature.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Light Clothing:</strong> Wear lightweight, breathable clothing and use a light blanket if you feel chilled.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Lukewarm Baths:</strong> Take a lukewarm bath or sponge bath to help bring down the fever. Avoid cold water as it can cause shivering, which may raise body temperature.</p>
            <p><strong>6. Ginger Tea:</strong> Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties. Make a ginger tea by boiling ginger slices in water, and drink it warm.</p>
            <p><strong>7. Honey and Lemon:</strong> Mix honey and lemon juice in warm water for a soothing drink that can help with throat irritation and hydration.</p>
            <p><strong>8. Peppermint Tea:</strong> Peppermint can help cool the body from the inside. Drink peppermint tea for its cooling effects.</p>
            <p><strong>9. Garlic:</strong> Garlic has antimicrobial properties. Eating raw garlic or adding it to your food may help your body fight infections.</p>
            <p><strong>10. Basil:</strong> Basil leaves have antibiotic properties. Boil basil leaves in water, strain, and drink the infusion.</p>
            <p><strong>11. Turmeric Milk:</strong> Turmeric has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Mix a teaspoon of turmeric in warm milk and drink it.</p>
            <p><strong>12. Essential Oils:</strong> Some essential oils like eucalyptus, peppermint, or lavender can be added to a diffuser to help soothe symptoms.</p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>These remedies can help alleviate symptoms but are not substitutes for medical treatment.</li>
                <li>Always check for allergies or potential interactions with medications you are taking.</li>
                <li>Seek medical attention if the fever is very high (above 103°F or 39.4°C), persistent (lasting more than 3 days), or accompanied by severe symptoms like difficulty breathing, chest pain, severe headache, stiff neck, rash, or seizures.</li>
